# Glitch
In class, we were introduced to the aesthetics of glitch art, and my mind began to imagine various pieces that I could potentially create with this form of creativity. I was very much influenced by the retro aesthetic that many glitch artists have seemed to use (VHS filters, for example), and I thought that attempting something like that with outer space based images would produced interesting artwork. Using Audacity, I bended the data using various effects to distort the image files, thus creating what I have presented in this repository. I also used pixel sorting by using Hex Fiend in order to create distorted images of space. Whenever we look at pictures of space, they're usually very peaceful and tranquil, so the idea was to distort them to challenge those themes, and introduce a little bit of "chaos." With some of these images I gave them a sort of static-like filter to simulate an older camera or maybe even an old television screen that is viewing the images. I also thought about how static-like audio and visual transmissions are in space, so that influenced the aesthetic as well. When it came to the images I chose from the internet, I kept some of the grounded in reality, and then the others in a more science fiction realm with dead looking astronauts, planets on the brink of destruction, and space pyramids. I think when it comes to the concept of outer space and science fiction (those two going hand in hand), there is a lot of room to experiment with visuals, and that is exactly what I got out of this project.
